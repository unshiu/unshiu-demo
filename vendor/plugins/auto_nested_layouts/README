AutoNestedLayouts
=================

Apply all hierarchical layout files automatically.


Example
=======

  class Admin::MemberController < ApplicationController
    nested_layouts (partial files, ...)
  end

When we call "admin/member/index" page,
it applies layout files in following order.

1. render "app/views/admin/member/index.rhtml" without layout.
2. apply "app/views/admin/member/_layout.rhtml" if exists.
3. apply "app/views/admin/_layout.rhtml" if exists.
4. apply "app/views/_layout.rhtml" if exists.


  app/views/admin/member/index.rhtml:
    Hello Nksk!

  app/views/admin/member/_layout.rhtml:
    [list member] [create member]
    <%= yield %>

  app/views/admin/_layout.rhtml:
    Admin: [menu1] [menu2]
    <%= yield %>

  app/views/_layout.rhtml:
    <%= yield %>

    [list member] [create member]
    Hello Nksk!
